# Azure IoT DeviceUpdate client library for .NET - version 1.1.0 


Azure.IoT.DeviceUpdate is a client library for developing .NET applications with rich experience.

## Getting started

### Install the package

Install the client library for .NET with [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/):

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Azure.IoT.DeviceUpdate
```

### Prerequisites

- You must have a [Microsoft Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/).

### Authenticate the client

To interact with the Device Update for IoT Hub service, you need to create an instance of a client class and authenticate it with a credential. The examples in this document use a credential object named `DefaultAzureCredential` from the [Azure.Identity](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/Azure.IoT.DeviceUpdate_1.1.0/sdk/identity/Azure.Identity/README.md) library to authenticate the client.

## Key concepts

The Device Update for IoT Hub client library contains clients for update management and device management operations.

## Examples

Code samples for using the management library for .NET can be found in the following locations
- [.NET Device Update Code Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/Azure.IoT.DeviceUpdate_1.1.0/sdk/deviceupdate/Azure.ResourceManager.DeviceUpdate/samples)

## Troubleshooting
